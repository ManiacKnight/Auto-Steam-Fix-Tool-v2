## NOTE: THIS REPO IS ONLY FOR ARCHIVE PURPOSES
### It also does **NOT** reflect on my current coding skills and techniques, this code hasn't been touched for 5+ years.

Auto Steam Fix Tool is the first "major"/public project I had worked on all the way back in 7th-8th grade.
It's nothing but an elementary automation tool created for ease of use purposes, generating and troubleshooting Steamworks Fixes (or Multiplayer Cracks) with just a few clicks.
The code isn't the best, miles from anything considered standard really. There is no use of functions, same lines of code have been repeated a lot and it overall is a giant mess.
Take this is an example of how you *SHOULD NOT* code.

### Why v2?
After I had managed to make a "functionally" working console project, I tried my hand at wrapping the gut-wrenching code around a fancy GUI.
For someone's first try at making a GUI project, I wouldn't say it looked *that bad*. I am quite proud of the GUI, at least.
Other than messy, unorganised code, no use of functions or objects, among other bugs, another thing I missed is anticipating that the user might not be the brightest person.
There are no exception handlers, and the code can easily fail without error logs if the user has incorrectly entered some parameter.

Another major feature for this release was the exemption of having to jot down every single DLC packages for the unlocker, findind out the appID, etc yourself.
The ease of use program got even ease of useier, as all you had to do now was paste the Game's steam store page link and the code would do the rest of the work for you.
